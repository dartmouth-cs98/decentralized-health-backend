# Database

## Purpose
The database holds basic information needed to access our website. At the moment, this only pertains to login related work, as much of the data handling is done using an external blockchain tool.

## Design
See the schema design below. The hello_world table exists solely for testing purposes. User passwords will be stored as a salted md5 hash.
