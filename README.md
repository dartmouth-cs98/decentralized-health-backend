# Decentralized Health - Back end 

The back end shall create a data management system that will help store patient information and then help write said information to the blockchain. 


## Architecture

We shall use Postgressql and a node.js database in order to store our data and then write said data to the blockchain. we have decided to use postgress as it is an opensource data management system that allows for integreations with blockchain apis. 

## Setup
Download postgressql here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/. after downloading the site will provide steps to continue and intialize your own server.
